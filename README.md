# Benchmark: Mongo Atlas vs Azure SQL

## Introduction

This document is a benchmark between Mongo Atlas and Azure SQL. The purpose of this benchmark is to compare the performance of both databases in terms of read and write operations. The benchmark will be performed using a Python script that will insert and read data from both databases. The script will measure the time it takes to perform each operation and will output the results in a CSV file. The benchmark will be performed on a dataset of 1000 records with the following fields: id, name, age, email, and phone number. The script will insert the records into the databases and then read them back to measure the performance of each database.
